# Single-Page-Website
A single page website which runs on Node js express and uses Ajax to navigate around the site without changing the URL or having to refresh the page

The website allows users to create an account or login to existing account. Once logged in the user can select an image to upload and try the caption and the post will be saved in the MYSQL database. The user can also view other people's post and search for others post.

The website also includes a validation which checks if an existing username exits, if the password entered is wrong or if the username used while logging in is invalid.

How to run the project -

Download node js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Open command prompt and run - npm install express --save
Now open the server.js file in your text editor ( I recommend webstorm)
Run the code and browse the site on localhost:8080
